## Familial hidradenitis suppurativa
HS is a chronic debilitating disease with typical inflamed nodules and connected abscesses in the axillae, groin, or perianal areas. The lesions may be difficult to treat without surgery or anti-inflammatory biologic treatments, and may recur even with successful treatment. Rarely, HS clusters in members of a family with a clear autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Some of these families have loss-of-function variants in members of the gamma-secretase complex, primarily Nicastrin. Other families do not have recognized variants in these genes.

This repository stores a CSV file that lists the genetic variants in HS families and sporadic cases, and the publications reporting them for public use and updating as new, rare mutations are discovered.
